HTML5 Logic Tree
================

Author: Robert Massaioli
Project Started: 22 Feb 2010

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this project is to create a suite where a programmer can type in a logical expression, 
made up purely of boolean values, and get a pretty image rendered to the screen.

Online Example
--------------

I have [setup an online link][1] to the test page for you to view. You can also [read the wiki pages][2] to find out more.

Example in 30 Seconds
---------------------

So you want to see an example of this in thirty seconds? Then seeing the test data in action is what you want:

1.  Checkout html5-logic-tree from GitHub.
2.  cd html5-logic-tree
3.  Use the (supported) browser of your choice to open 'test.html'.
    For example:
    google-chrome test/test.html
4.  Win!

Supported Browsers
------------------

+ [Google Chrome][3]
+ [Firefox][4]

However, any browser that supports HTML5 canvas objects should be acceptable.
